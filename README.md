**Live production build here: https://amazing-starlight-c69366.netlify.app/.**

This frontend web application delivers local weather information based on postal code using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/) and [ZipCodeBase API](https://zipcodebase.com/). It is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and some vanilla Javascript.

## Features

- Lookup by postal code
- Current, hourly forecast, and 7-day forecast weather data
- Filter data type using the slider at the top of the results page
- Dynamic background image based on current weather and day vs. night
- Desktop and mobile support

## Planned features

- International support (currently US only)
- Lookup by other location parameters (eg. city or region)
- Lookup using HTML Geolocation API
- Persistent user data in browser based on previous lookup
- ~~7-day forecast weather data~~âœ…

## Current limitations and known bugs

- The country selector works but only US lookup is available
- Background image loads only after a noticeable delay
