# Reddit Client

**Live production build here: https://reddit-lw.app/**

This app is a light and minimal front-end Reddit client that displays the default view of Reddit (as if you were signed out) from the [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/JSON).

It is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).

## Features

- View the homepage of Reddit, sorted by what's üî• hot, ‚ú® new, ‚¨ÜÔ∏è top, or üìà rising.
- Visit any subreddit, sorted using the same selector that can be used on the homepage.
- Check the comment section of a thread, and expand or collapse comments and subcomments.
- Search Reddit for the content you are looking for.
- Scroll infinitely on the homepage or within subreddit.
- Desktop and mobile support
- Videos play smoothly using [ReactPlayer](https://github.com/cookpete/react-player) for Reddit Video and [React Tiny Oembed](https://github.com/muzam1l/react-tiny-oembed) for third-party embedded content..

## Planned features

- Search for subreddits by name, or search within a subreddit.
- Read more comments buttons load more comments.
